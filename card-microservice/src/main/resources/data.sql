It discharges powerful magnetic waves at high voltage. Generates strange radio signals. It raises the temperature by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit within 3,300 feet. Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result, large cities sound sirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this Pokémon. Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to electronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokémon inside a Poké Ball. When three Magnemite link together, their brains also become one. They do not become three times more intelligent. It has about three times the electrical power of Magnemite. For some reason, outbreaks of this Pokémon happen when lots of sunspots appear. Delicate equipment can malfunction in areas inhabited by Magneton, which send out mysterious electrical signals. When rain clouds form, many Magneton gather in high places to wait for lightning to strike. Generates strange radio signals. It raises the temperature by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit within 3,300 feet.

Pinsir is astoundingly strong. It can grip a foe weighing twice its weight in its horns and easily lift it. This Pokémon’s movements turn sluggish in cold places. Pinsir has a pair of massive horns. Protruding from the surface of these horns are thorns. These thorns are driven deeply into the foe’s body when the pincer closes, making it tough for the foe to escape. It grips its prey in its pincers and splits them apart. Although it is a powerful Pokémon, it can’t deal with the cold. One solid blow from its horns is enough to split apart a large tree. Its greatest rival in Alola is Vikavolt. It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt. For some reason, it apparently gets along well with Heracross in Alola.
